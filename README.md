# UFOs
# Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
# Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

1. Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  The purpose of this analysis is to rebuild dynamic table to be searchable by the input data.  
  This allow users to filter any input they entered, city, state, country, or shape.  

2. Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
   * In this website, you can search by shape. 
   * Additionally you can input multiple search criteria to narrow down the results. 
   * The example is below:

3. Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
  * it does not have dropdown to choose a state or a shape, and this will provide the convenient. 
  * it does not have a "search Button" to click to execute our search instead.  
  * I would recommend to create the "search Button" and to create the dropdown to choose a State, a country or Shape.
